"The current platform only provides data in Excel format. I believe that incorporating visualizations can enhance users' understanding of their data. 
To address this, I developed an app using Streamlit. The app functions by allowing users to upload their data, applying filters for data selection, automatically generating predefined charts for visualization, and enabling users to customize their visualizations.
This app will be web-based and free to use, eliminating the need for users to invest in expensive tools like Power BI or Tableau. There are no additional costs associated with using the app, making it accessible to everyone. Users can easily visualize their data without any prior technical expertise, streamlining the data analysis process. Additionally, the app's user-friendly interface encourages exploration and enhances data-driven decision-making, fostering a greater understanding of insights derived from their data
